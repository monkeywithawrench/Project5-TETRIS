# Project5-TETRIS
Tetris clone in JavaFX, group project for my Object Oriented Programming class. Colab between Darby Green and I.

Because this was posted a year after the project was completed, here's a
general rundown of who did what. I, Jeff Morton, was responsible for all
the logic of the Tetris game. That includes all the board operations and
management. Darby Green was responsible for the JavaFX side of the
project. We worked together on the project, usually sitting next to each
other, and we helped each other where we could.
